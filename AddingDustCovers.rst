Adding Dust Covers

It is a good idea to add a dust cover to the back of a frame that contains art, in order to seal in the contents. It protects the art from dust and debris. It also gives the frame a professional look.

<add diagram here>

Dust covers are best used for art that will stay in the frame for a long time. If the art will be removed, it might be better to leave off the dust cover.

You will need the following materials to add a dust cover to a frame:

* a piece of dust cover material a little larger than the outside dimensions of the frame
* scissors (optional) for the initial cut
* |xb| with a fresh blade
* mounting tape

Add a Dust Cover to the New Frame
*********************************

Cut and apply a dust cover to the back of the frame:

#. Gather the materials.

#. Cut the dust cover so that it is larger than the frame. Place the dust cover on a hard, smooth surface. You may find it helpful to weigh down the corners to keep the dust cover relatively flat.

#. Apply mounting tape to the frame pieces, about 1/8" away from the outer edges. Peel off the top adhesive from the mounting tape.

#. Attach the dust cover securely to the frame by pressing the back of the frame onto the dust cover firmly. There should be some dust cover material overlapping each side of the frame.

#. Hold the |xb| firmly at a consistent distance of about 1/8" from each edge of the frame and trim the dust cover on all sides.

#. Remove any excess tape adhesive that extends beyond the boundaries of the dust cover by rubbing it off with your finger. Discard unneeded pieces of dust cover material that are too small to be reused.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

.. note::
   Always use a fresh |xb|. This is a key factor in quality.

.. warning::
   An |xb| is very sharp. It is easy to seriously cut yourself. Be careful and be ready to bandage a cut or seek emergency attention.

.. warning::
   When changing an |xb|, discard the used blade safely so it will not hurt anyone else.
   
Now the frame will keep dust from entering inside the frame, which makes the display look clean and new. The back of the frame now looks more professional than it would without a dust cover.

Put away the supplies used for this task.
