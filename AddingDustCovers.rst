Add a Dust Cover
****************

.. note::
   Always use a fresh |xb|. This is a key factor in quality.

.. note::
   When trimming the dust backing, keep your hand firm that is holding the |xb| as you move it along the frame edge. Use the frame edge as a guide to keep the blade a consistent distance from the edge. A good distance from the edge to trim the cover is about 1/8".

.. warning::
   An |xb| is very sharp. It is easy to seriously cut yourself. Be careful and be ready to bandage a cut or seek emergency attention.

.. warning::
   When changing an |xb|, discard the used blade safely so it will not hurt anyone else.
   
Add a dust cover to the back of the frame:

#. Gather the materials.

#. Cut the dust backing so that it is larger than the frame.

#. Apply mounting tape to the frame pieces, about 1/8" away from the outer edges.

#. Attach the dust backing securely to the frame. Remove any excess tape adhesive that you can feel. 

#. Discard unneeded pieces of dust backing material that are too small to be reused.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

Now the frame will keep dust from entering inside the frame, which makes the display look clean and new. The back of the frame now looks more professional than it would without a dust backing.

Put away the supplies used for this task.
