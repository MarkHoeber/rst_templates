Add a Dust Cover
****************

Add a dust cover to the back of the frame:

#. Gather the materials.

#. Cut the dust backing so that it is larger than the frame.

#. Apply mounting tape to the frame pieces, about 1/8" away from the outer edges.

#. Attach the dust backing securely to the frame. Remove any excess tape adhesive that you can feel. Add these notes:

    * always use a fresh blade
    * hold your cutting hand firmly and consistently while running it along the frame piece for a good looking trim
Add these cautions:
    * blades are very sharp. It is easy to seriously cut yourself. Be careful and be ready to bandage a cut or seek emergency attention.
    * how to discard used blades safely

#. Discard unneeded pieces of dust backing material that are too small to be reused.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

Now the frame will keep dust from entering inside the frame, which makes the display look clean and new. The back of the frame now looks more professional than it would without a dust backing.

Put away the supplies used for this task.
