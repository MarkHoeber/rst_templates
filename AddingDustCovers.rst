Add a Dust Cover
****************

Add a dust cover to the back of the frame:

#. Gather materials

#. Cut the dust backing larger than the frame.

#. Apply mounting tape.

#. Attach the dust backing securely to the frame. Remove any excess tape adhesive that you can feel sticking.
Add these notes:
- always use a fresh blade
- hold your cutting hand firmly and consistently while running it along the frame piece for a good looking trim
Add these cautions:
- blades are very sharp. It is easy to seriously cut yourself. Be careful and be ready to bandage a cut or seek emergency attention.
- how to discard used blades safely

#. Discard unneeded pieces.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

Now the frame will keep dust from entering inside the frame, which makes the display look clean and fresh. The back of the rame now looks very professional.

Put away the supplies used for this task.
