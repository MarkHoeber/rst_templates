Procedure
=====================================

********************************
    1. Set up the test station.
********************************

        a) Turn on the temperature controller.  Select the temperature according to the chart under Equipment.
             
        #) Place about 300 milliliters and the stir bar into the beaker.

        #) Place the beaker on the stir plate.

        #) Use the laboratory stand and the clips to suspend both sensors in the water.  The sensor ends should be submerged at least 2 centimeters below the water's surface and not touching each other, the beaker sides, or the beaker bottom.  Add more RO water if needed.

        #) Turn the stir plate on and adjust its speed so that the stir bar agitates the water but a well does not form.

        #) Connect each sensor to its meter.

        #) Set the meter displays to show temperature in degrees Celsius to two decimal places.  

        #) Check the temperature multiplier and the temperature additive in both meters.  The factors in the reference system must match the label on the reference sensor.  The factors in the meter used with the unit under test must be a multiplier of 1.0000 and an additive of 0.0000 ohms.  Adjust the values if required.


**************************
2. Set up the data sheet.
**************************

        a) Open the template file "Sensor Temperature Calibration" from the desktop of the laboratory computer.  Save a copy to the Calibration Data folder on the desk top.  Name the new data sheet using today's date and the serial number of the sensor being calibrated in the format YYMMDD-serialnumber.

        #) Record the part numbers and serial numbers of both sets of meters and sensors into the new data sheet.

        #) Check the calibration dates of the reference equipment and record the due dates of their next calibration.

        #) Record the temperature and percent humidity of the laboratory.  This data is found on the weather station set up on the chemical bench.

****************************
3. Perform the calibration.
****************************
.. note::
    Make sure the temperature of the RO water in the beaker is stable before starting the calibration.


        a) Record the temperature displayed by the reference system into the new data sheet.

        #) Record the temperature displayed by the new sensor.  The worksheet returns the calculated temperature additive for the unit under test.

        #) Program the calculated additive into the meter.  

        
**************************
4. Verify the calibration.
**************************

        a) In the "After" section of the worksheet, record the temperatures displayed by both temperature systems.  The temperatures must agree within 0.05 degrees Celsius to pass calibration.  If the performance does not pass, repeat the calibration steps.
        
.. caution::
    If a second try is necessary, be sure to return the temperature additive for the unit under test back to 0.0000 ohms, otherwise the calculation in the worksheet will be incorrect.
    
*****************************
5. Document the calibration.
*****************************

        a) Write on the calibration tag the date, sensor serial number, and new temperature additive.

        #) Attach the tag to the unit under test.

        #) Initial and date the worksheet.

        #) Print a copy of the worksheet.

*****************************************************************************
6.  Deliver the paper copy and the tagged sensor to the Quality Department.
*****************************************************************************

***************************
7.  Clean up the work area.
***************************

        a) Pour the water from the beaker into the laboratory sink.

        #) Rinse the beaker and stir bar with clean water and set them on the drying rack over the sink.

        #) Return all other equipment to the proper storage area.
