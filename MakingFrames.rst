Introducing Frame-Making
************************

At |llc|, we typically make our own frames. We sell these frames to customers as well as use them to display our art at events, at galleries, and on our studio walls. Offering frames for sale is a secondary service to our customers for these reasons: 

* It saves the customer time and hassle to go get it framed later.
* The customer may be gifting the art to a third party, and having the art already framed makes it attractive, quick, and easy to hand it to someone else ready to hang.
* Frames protect the artwork so the customer don't have to worry about how to store the art safely while it is unframed.
* Framing through |llc| is typically cheaper than a frame shop, since it is not our main product and we are not trying to make a big profit from it.
* The customer can be assured that we will make the frame look good with the art.

Framing is optional to our customers. A customer may prefer to purchase artwork left unframed because:
* It is less expensive upfront to buy the artwork unframed. The customer can wait to find the funds to pay for framing.
* The customer may be happy with how the art appears unframed and may never desire to get it framed.
* The customer may be gifting the art to a third party and may not know the end recipient's decorating style.
* The customer may want to choose a frame later from more options when they are ready  to match it to their own decorating style.
* The customer may prefer a different matting than what we offer, so it makes sense to wait until later to frame the art.

We offer basic frame choices. We can also do custom frame work if asked, which may cost more and take longer.

Why Make Our Own Frames?
========================
* We prefer to use wood frames, and it is not always easy to find good, affordable, wood frames when you want them. We choose wood because:
    - Wood frames meet expectations for a professional appearance.
    - Some art galleries require wood frames.
    - Wood is durable, so you don't need to worry about a frame falling apart during a show.
    - You can drill into the back of a wood frame for wiring on the back, which is often required by an art gallery.
* We can control the quality and not worry about the condition of an online shipment of premade frames.
* We do not need to worry about transporting premade frames.
* We can typically save the customer money by framing it for them.
* We can save a lot of money for ourselves when framing our art for shows and events.
* We can make frames in any quantity on demand at any time of day or night. This comes in handy when doing last-minute preparations into the late hours.
* We can easily repair a frame immediately as long as we have the parts.

What Types of Frames do We Make?
================================

more text will go here, add a table showing the frame types, define "glazing", perhaps talk about when to use plexi vs glass and how to tell them apart, maybe an external link to frame pictures on our Etsy shop

Making the Frames
*****************

Making frames the way we do at |llc| takes a bit of muscle strength. It is a good idea to practice making frame before you are in a rush to complete an order. Here are some helpful hints to keep in mind:

- It takes time to make a frame. Allow enough time so you don't feel rushed or tired.
- It is great to have a vacuum cleaner handy to keep clean up the sawdust you will create.
- Expect mistakes! So:
    * Double-check all calculations and measurements before cutting anything.
    * Some equipment may be slightly faulty, so remember how to adjust for any of these slight errors.
    * Have extra materials in case something gets ruined.
    * Start while you still have extra time, if possible, so that you will have enough time in case you have to redo something.
    * Smile and be nice to yourself. Enjoy the beautiful product you will have made when you took the time to make or redo it correctly.

Obtaining the Needed Materials
==============================

The materials to make a frame will vary depending on the type of frame. Decide how much of each material to keep on hand, finding a balance between:
- funds available
- expected demand
- length of time available to complete an order. For example, will you have time to wait for a moulding order to arrive once a customer places an order or |llc| commits to participating in an event?
- storage space to hold the materials before making the frames

Gather your materials in plenty of time before you need them. We recommend allotting at least two weeks to restock supplies. Also, make sure there is enough moulding on hand before the last couple weeks in December each year, because our preferred supplier shuts down during that time period. 

Understand the General Steps Involved
=====================================

The steps below describe an overview of how you will make the frames. You may find that you are able to do some steps, wait, and then finish on another day. This could save time later so that when you are a rush, maybe all you will have to do when you get an order is to secure the contents and finish up.

Make an Art Frame, General Steps
********************************

Follow these general steps to get the necessary materials and to produce an art frame. Click on a link within a step for more details:

#. Get the materials (TBD), more text might go here, maybe add a note to not order moulding that is too wide, heavy, or tall and tell my story of doing this.

#. Make the basic frame rectangle (TBD), more text might go here, this involves cutting, sanding, and joining moulding pieces. Maybe add a note that the basic frame rectangle could be stored and sold separately as is.

#. Prepare the contents (TBD), more text might go here, contents should already be mounted and matted if needed, you might need to add a foam core backing to make the back level with the frame, add a liner if making a shadow box, remove any covers on plexiglass, add a caution of how to dispose of broken glass.

#. Secure the contents in the frame (TBD), more text might go here, remove any dust or debris while doing this.

#. Add a dust backing if needed (see separate topic).

#. Wire the frame (TBD) more text might go here, this process will differ depending on whether you are making a regular frame or an |ez| frame.

#. Finish up the frame creation (see separate topic).

Now you have a wonderful new frame! Clean up the work area, and make sure everything is put away. Arrange for supplies to be replenished. Update the inventory control system. Either package the frame and store it, or prepare it for upcoming delivery. Inform the appropriate people that the frame is ready.
