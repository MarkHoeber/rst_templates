Finish the New Frame
********************

Add rubber bumpers and labels to the new frame:

#. Gather the supplies.

#. Plug in the hot glue gun. Make sure a glue stick is fully inserted. Add a caution to position the glue gun safely on a protective surface. Add a caution to not touch the tip of the glue gun while it is hot. Wait for a few minutes for the glue gun to warm up until you can squeeze hot glue out of the glue gun.

#. Add the bumpers, using the hot glue gun. Add a diagram of where to place the bumpers. Unplug the glue gun. Let it cool down while you continue.

#. Add labels, as many as are required for this product. Explain more...Use Dymo. Possibly more than one label if there are contents, one for the contents and one for the frame. And maybe one for a map disclosure.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

You are done making the frame! Add a caution to make sure the glue gun is cool enough to put away. Put away materials used for this task. Perform any follow steps for Making an Art Frame (add link back to previous page).
