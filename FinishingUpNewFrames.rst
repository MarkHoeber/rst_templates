Finish the New Frame
********************

Add rubber bumpers and labels to the new frame:

#. Gather supplies.

#. Plug in the hot glue gun. Make sure a glue stick is fully inserted. Add a caution to position the glue gun safely on a protective surface.

#. Add bumpers, using hot glue gun. Add a diagram of where to place the bumpers. Unplug the glue gun. Let it cool down while you continue.

#. Add labels, as many as required. Use Dymo. Possibly more than one label if there are contents, one for the contents and one for the frame. And maybe one for a map disclosure.

#. Arrange for supplies to be replenished.

You are done making the frame! Add a caution to make sure the glue gun is cool enough to put away. Put away materials used for this task. Perform any follow steps for Making an Art Frame.
