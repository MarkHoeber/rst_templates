Theory of Temperature Measurement
--------------------------------------
Many measurements made in solutions in the laboratory, such as pH and conductivity, rely on correct temperature inputs in order to calculate the measurements accurately.  Most temperature measurements in such devices are based upon measured resistance across specific metal elements.  A typical example is platinum metal configured so that 1000 ohms corresponds to 0 degC.  As the temperature that the platinum is exposed to rises, so does the metal's resistance. The resistance-to-temperature relationship has been well documented.

This is called the Callendar-Van Dusen equation, in the form for temperature >0degC:

.. math::
Rt = R0 * (1 + A*t + B*t^2)

Where:

Rt is the resistance at temperature t

R0 is the resistance at 0degC

A = 3.9083 E-3

B = -5.775 E-7
