Calibrating a Sensor for Temperature
######################################

.. include:: ../../shared/utils/page_toc.txt

If topic has multiple sections, use page-toc.txt utility ^^. Otherwise remove.

Only add text under Heading 1 if there are no subsections


Equipment
***********

* Qualified reference temperature system consisting of a sensor and a meter with a display
* Recirculating temperature controller with a range of 20degC to 60degC
* 500-milliliter jacketed beaker connected to the temperature controller via flexible tubing
* Magnetic stir bar and stir plate
* Reduced organic (RO) water
* Laboratory stand with support arm and clips
* New sensor to callibrate and a compatible reference meter
* Calibration tag

Procedure
****************
#. Set up the test station.
 #. Place about 300 milliliters of RO water and the stir bar into the beaker.

Complex concepts may contain 2 or more subsections.


What is <part of subject> ?
============================

When you need to break down a subject, you can break it down into subsections (H3s). Typically you woul have 0 H3s, or 2+ H3s.

Do this
***********

A task typicallly follows conceptual information. Task titles should be imperative. Tasks should have a short introduction sentence that captures the user's goal and introduces the steps, for example, "Verify your products are in the catalog:"

A task should have 3 - 7 steps.  Tasks with more should be broken down into digestible chunks.

Intro sentence.

#. Step 1.

#. Step 2.

#. Step 3.

Following the steps, you should add the result and any follow-up tasks needed.

Typically, each topic must contain the project includes file.
