Calibrating a Sensor for Temperature
=====================================
***************
Equipment
***************
 
 * Qualified reference temperature system consisting of a sensor and a meter with a display
 * Circulating temperature controller with a range of 20degC to 60degC
 * 500-milliliter jacketed glass beaker connected to the temperature controller via flexible tubing
 * Magnetic stir bar and stir plate
 * Laboratory stand with support arm and clips
 * Reduced organic (RO) water
 * New sensor to calibrate and a compatible reference meter
 * Calibration tag
 
 
 Select temperature based upon the part number of the sensor undergoing calibration.
