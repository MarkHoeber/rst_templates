Each Sphinx project has an index page, as well as index pages for parts of the document, which align to subfolders.

Start each index page with a summary of the document or part, followed by the
toctree command and links to the index file for each part, or topics within that
part.

Example for index:

.. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      file
      file
      file
      file
